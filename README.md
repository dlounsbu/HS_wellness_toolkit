This repository includes materials to support wellness programming in US high schools via a participatory research project funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  (NIDDK R01 DK097096; Wylie-Rosett, PI). 

With <b>HealthCorp</b> http://www.healthcorps.org and <b>FamilyCookProductions</b> http://familycookproductions.org/, researchers at the <b>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</b> https://www.einstein.yu.edu/about/ developed and tested school-based activities that foster behavior change consistent with the HSS/USDA Dietary Guidelines for adolescents. Focusing on activities that would help develop the school’s collaborative capacity and its students’ skill-based learning, the project’s partners worked to design and pilot a multi-component toolkit for wellness programming in diverse high schools.
