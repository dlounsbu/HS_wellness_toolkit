<b>HealthCorp</b> http://www.healthcorps.org and <b>FamilyCookProductions</b> http://familycookproductions.org/ - along with many students, teachers, and parents from participating schools - joined with researchers at the <b>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</b> https://www.einstein.yu.edu/about/ to create and test school-based activities that foster behavior change consistent with the HHS/USDA Dietary Guidelines for adolescents https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/. Focusing on activities that would help develop the school’s collaborative capacity and its students’ skill-based learning, the project’s partners worked to design and pilot a multi-component toolkit for wellness programming in diverse high schools.
