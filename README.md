# HS_wellness_toolkit
This repository includes materials to support wellness programming in US high schools via a participatory research project funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  (NIDDK R01 DK097096; Wylie-Rossett, PI). 

The purpose of the research was to jointly develop and test school-based activities that foster behavior change consistent with the dietary guidelines for adolescents. Focusing on activities that would help develop the school’s collaborative capacity and its students’ skill-based learning, the project’s partners worked to design and pilot a multi-component toolkit for wellness programming in diverse high schools.
